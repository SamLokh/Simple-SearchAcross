# Simple-SearchAcross
The HTML, Javascript files are bascially to be used to create an ionic app (say using something like Apache Cordova), but can also be used as a website. The app functions like a simple seach system. You can search the meaning of a certain word across a number of different websites like Investopedia (for a finance specific meaning), Google, Oxford Dictionary, Wiktionary. You can see the list of the words and also the number of times you've searched. Thats pretty much all this app does. I feel like its useful when you need to get a number of meanings for the same word, you can just bounce off of the different sources quickly. It does not have the functionality to actually store the meaning of the words unlike the Custom-Dictionary project, which makes it simpler.
