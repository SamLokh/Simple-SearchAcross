# Simple-SearchAcross

USEFUL for searching the meanings/definitions of a term across a number of websites like Investopedia, Google, Oxford Dictionary, Wiktionary at the click of a single button corresposding to that website and back and another button for a different website, without having to enter the term in that particular website and clicking go than going to a different website for another definition and repeating the process.

The HTML, Javascript files are bascially to be used to create an ionic app (say using something like Apache Cordova), but can also be used as a website. The app functions like a simple seach system. You can search the meaning of a certain word across a number of different websites like Investopedia (for a finance specific meaning), Google, Oxford Dictionary, Wiktionary. You can see the list of the words and also the number of times you've searched. Thats pretty much all this app does. I feel like its useful when you need to get a number of meanings for the same word, you can just bounce off of the different sources quickly. It does not have the functionality to actually store the meaning of the words unlike the Custom-Dictionary project, which makes it simpler.

Please note that I created this project just after I learned Javascript and creating cross-platform apps using Apache Cordova. I was naive back then. After I got the project to do what I wanted it to do, I kinda abandoned it and did not make any improvements later (it definitely needs some).
